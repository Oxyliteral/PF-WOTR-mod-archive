# PF-WOTR-mod-archive
archive for created mods which use WOTR's own mod system

NOTE:
For mods to work, there MUST be "Assemblies" and "Bundles" folder inside the same folder as "Blueprints". However, due to how github works, empty folders cannot be uploaded. Please make them manually.

Alignment:
All Mythic Paths are any Alignment.

Legend:
Modifies Legend EXP table to be in 2 to 1 compared to normal exp table.

Mythic:
Allows faster and more front-loaded mythic levels, not tested (especially Legend, as who knows how game handles you being a Legend early in the game.
Update: Played through early Legend. Game initially does not let you out of Drezen rooftop, but that is modable. Had some issues in chapter 3 with some quest chains not starting. Wintersun can be found manually, and Molten Scar has been edited to be findable without any conditions.

Paladin:
Buffs Paladin class and Radiance sword.


SpeedyExhaustion:
Removes slow effect on Exhaustion debuff.
