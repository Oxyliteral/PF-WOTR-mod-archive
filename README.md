# PF-WOTR-mod-archive
archive for created mods which use WOTR's own mod system

NOTE:
For mods to work, there MUST be "Assemblies" and "Bundles" folder inside the same folder as "Blueprints". However, due to how github works, empty folders cannot be uploaded. Please make them manually.

Alignment:
All Mythic Paths are any Alignment.

Legend:
Modifies Legend EXP table to be 2 to 1 compared to normal exp table.

Mythic:
Allows faster and more front-loaded mythic levels, also allows Legend to be picked on Drezen rooftop.
List of changes to accomodate:
Mythic levels in prologue (upon gaining light power and upon defeating maze boss).
Drezen rooftop exit node (does not normally allow Legend to exit).
Areelu's Lab changed to be discoverable even without Mythic Quests.
Goddess Summit edited (can choose between original game Legend or new Secret Ending Legend which does not give certain etudes).
Note: Areelu dialogue directly checks if you are Legend etude, so the following have been edited to compensate with the above:
Areelu's secret lab dialogue
Threshold dialogue

Additional changes:
Month/day requirement for secret ending removed.
Includes bug fix for Seelah companion quest (Meet Elan in Drezen etude -> Meet Elan in Barracks etude).
Due to game being slightly buggy (I don't know if its because of the mod or just the game being the game, certain quests/companion quests seem to not trigger due to not having Mythic Quest in Legend.
Current changes because of the above:
Molten Scar is now findable without quest.

Update: Played through Legend secret ending. Had some issues in chapter 3 with some quest chains not starting. Wintersun can be found manually, and Molten Scar has been edited to be findable without any conditions. Secret ending works as normal. Areelu/other reactions sometimes revert to Legend, but all conversations that give etudes should be fine. 6/7 of soft requirements are achievable. (7th unachievable one is the reach rank 10 in certain mythic classes that areelu favors).

Paladin:
Buffs Paladin class and Radiance sword.


SpeedyExhaustion:
Removes character speed slow effect on Exhaustion debuff.
